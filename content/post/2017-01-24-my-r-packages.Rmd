A full list of R packages I have published are on [my Github](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234), but some notable ones are below.

Some are part of the [cloudyR project](http://cloudyr.github.io/), which has many packages useful for using R in the cloud. ![](/images/cloudyr2.png) 

I concentrate on the Google cloud below, but be sure to check out the other packages if you're looking to work with AWS or other cloud based services.
